## 📦 Installation

You can simply use Pip for installation.

```
pip install robyn
```

Or, with [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/)

```
conda install -c conda-forge robyn
```

## 🤔 Usage

### 🚀 Define your API

To define your API, you can add the following code in an `app.py` file.

```python
from robyn import Robyn

app = Robyn(__file__)

@app.get("/")
async def h(request):
    return "Hello, world!"

app.start(port=8080)
```

### 🏃 Run your code

Simply run the app.py file you created. You will then have access to a server on the `localhost:8080`, that you can request from an other program. Robyn provides several options to customize your web server.

```
$ python3 app.py
```

To see the usage

```
usage: app.py [-h] [--processes PROCESSES] [--workers WORKERS] [--dev] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL]

Robyn, a fast async web framework with a rust runtime.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --processes PROCESSES
                        Choose the number of processes. [Default: 1]
  --workers WORKERS     Choose the number of workers. [Default: 1]
  --dev                 Development mode. It restarts the server based on file changes.
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        Set the log level name
  --create              Create a new project template.
  --docs                Open the Robyn documentation.
  --open-browser        Open the browser on successful start.
  --version             Show the Robyn version.
  --compile-rust-path COMPILE_RUST_PATH
                        Compile rust files in the given path.
  --create-rust-file CREATE_RUST_FILE
                        Create a rust file with the given name.
  --disable-openapi     Disable the OpenAPI documentation.
  --fast                Enable the fast mode.
```

Log level can be `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, or `ERROR`.

When running the app using `--open-browser` a new browser window will open at the app location, e.g:

```
$ python3 app.py --open-browser
```

### 💻 Add more routes

You can add more routes to your API. Check out the routes in [this file](https://github.com/sparckles/Robyn/blob/main/integration_tests/base_routes.py) as examples.

### ⚙️ To Develop Locally

#### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python >= 3.8, < 3.12 , Support for Python 3.13 is coming soon!
- Rust (latest stable)
- C compiler (gcc/clang)

#### Setup

- Clone the repository:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/sparckles/Robyn.git
  ```

- Setup a virtual environment:
  ```
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

- Install required packages

  ```
  pip install pre-commit poetry maturin
  ```
- Install development dependencies
  ```
  poetry install --with dev --with test
  ```
- Install pre-commit git hooks
  ```
  pre-commit install
  ```
- Build & install Robyn Rust package
  ```
  maturin develop
  ```
- Build & install Robyn Rust package (**experimental**)
  ```
  maturin develop --cargo-extra-args="--features=io-uring"
  ```
- Run!
  ```
  poetry run test_server
  ```
- Run all tests
  ```
  pytest
  ```
- Run only the integration tests
  ```
  pytest integration_tests
  ```
- Run only the unit tests (you don't need to be running the test_server for these)
  ```
  pytest unit_tests
  ```
- Test (refer to `integration_tests/base_routes.py` for more endpoints)
  ```
  curl http://localhost:8080/sync/str
  ```

- **tip:** One liners for testing changes!
  ```
  maturin develop && poetry run test_server

  maturin develop && pytest 
  ```

- **tip:** For IO-uring support, you can use the following command:
  ```
  maturin develop --cargo-extra-args="--features=io-uring"
  ```

- **tip:** To use your local Robyn version in other projects, you can install it using pip:
  ```
  pip install -e path/to/robyn/target/wheels/robyn-<version>-<python_version>-<platform>.whl
  ```
e.g.
  ```
  pip install -e /repos/Robyn/target/wheels/robyn-0.63.0-cp312-cp312-macosx_10_15_universal2.whl
  ```

#### Troubleshooting
If you face any issues, here are some common fixes:
  - install `patchelf` with `pip install patchelf` if you face `patchelf` not found issue during `maturin develop` (esp. on Arch Linux)
  - If you get Rust compilation errors, ensure you have a C compiler installed:
    - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install build-essential`
    - Fedora: `sudo dnf install gcc`
    - macOS: Install Xcode Command Line Tools
    - Windows: Install Visual Studio Build Tools
