## Multiprocess Execution

Batman wondered about the behavour of variables in a Robyn multiprocessing environment.

Robyn reassured that it can indeed support them! i.e, handlers can be dispatched to multiple threads.

Any variable used in a multiprocessing environment is shared across multiple processes.

Whilst using multithreading in Robyn, the variables are not protected from multiple threads access by default.

If one needs a variable to be protected within a process, while accessing it from different threads, one can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Value">`multiprocessing.Value`</a> for achieving the required protection.

## What's next?


Batman wondered if it was possible to use Rust directly from Robyn's codebase.

Robyn showed him the path.
