After Creating a basic version of the app, Batman wanted to restrict the access to the Gotham Police Department. So, he enquired about the Authentication functionalities in Robyn.


## Authentication


As Batman found out, Robyn provides an easy way to add an authentication middleware to your application. You can then specify `auth_required=True` in your routes to make them accessible only to authenticated users.

    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

    ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
    @app.get("/auth", auth_required=True)
    async def auth(request: Request):
        # This route method will only be executed if the user is authenticated
        # Otherwise, a 401 response will be returned
        return "Hello, world"
    ```

    ```python {{title: 'typed'}}
    @app.get("/auth", auth_required=True)
    async def auth(request: Request):
        # This route method will only be executed if the user is authenticated
        # Otherwise, a 401 response will be returned
        return "Hello, world"

    ```

  To add an authentication middleware, you can use the `configure_authentication` method. This method requires an `AuthenticationHandler` object as an argument. This object specifies how to authenticate a user, and uses a `TokenGetter` object to retrieve the token from the request. Robyn does currently provide a `BearerGetter` class that gets the token from the `Authorization` header, using the `Bearer` scheme. Here is an example of a basic authentication handler:


  </Col>
  <Col sticky>
    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

      ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
      class BasicAuthHandler(AuthenticationHandler):
        def authenticate(self, request: Request) -> Optional[Identity]:
            token = self.token_getter.get_token(request)
            if token == "valid":
                return Identity(claims={})
            return None

      app.configure_authentication(BasicAuthHandler(token_getter=BearerGetter()))

      ```

      ```python {{title: 'typed'}}
      class BasicAuthHandler(AuthenticationHandler):
        def authenticate(self, request: Request) -> Optional[Identity]:
            token = self.token_getter.get_token(request)
            if token == "valid":
                return Identity(claims={})
            return None

      app.configure_authentication(BasicAuthHandler(token_getter=BearerGetter()))

      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>

The authenticate method should return an `Identity` object if the user is authenticated, or `None` otherwise. The Identity object can contain any data you want, and will be accessible in the route methods using the `request.identity` attribute.

<b>
  Note: that this authentication system is basically only using a `before request` middleware under the hood. This means you can overlook it and create your own authentication system using middlewares if you want to. However, Robyn still provides this easy to implement solution that should suit most use cases.

## What's next?

Now, that Batman has learned about authentication, he wanted to know about certain optimization techniques that he could use to make his application faster. He found out about the following features
