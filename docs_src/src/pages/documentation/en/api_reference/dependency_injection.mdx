## Dependency Injection

Batman wanted to learn about dependency injection in Robyn. Robyn introduced him to the concept of dependency injection and how it can be used in Robyn.



Robyn has two types of dependency injection:
One is for the application level and the other is for the router level.

### Application Level Dependency Injection

<Row>
<Col>
Application level dependency injection is used to inject dependencies into the application. These dependencies are available to all the requests.
</Col>
  <Col>

    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

    ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
      from robyn import Robyn, ALLOW_CORS

      app = Robyn(__file__)
      GLOBAL_DEPENDENCY = "GLOBAL DEPENDENCY"

      app.inject_global(GLOBAL_DEPENDENCY=GLOBAL_DEPENDENCY)

      @app.get("/sync/global_di")
      def sync_global_di(request, global_dependencies):
        return global_dependencies["GLOBAL_DEPENDENCY"]
    ```

    ```python {{ title: 'typed' }}
      from robyn import Robyn, ALLOW_CORS

      app = Robyn(__file__)
      GLOBAL_DEPENDENCY = "GLOBAL DEPENDENCY"

      app.inject_global(GLOBAL_DEPENDENCY=GLOBAL_DEPENDENCY)

      @app.get("/sync/global_di")
      def sync_global_di(request, global_dependencies):
        return global_dependencies["GLOBAL_DEPENDENCY"]

    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>


### Router Level Dependency Injection

<Row>
<Col>
Router level dependency injection is used to inject dependencies into the router. These dependencies are available to all the requests of that router.
</Col>
  <Col>

    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

    ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
      from robyn import Robyn, ALLOW_CORS

      app = Robyn(__file__)
      ROUTER_DEPENDENCY = "ROUTER DEPENDENCY"

      app.inject(ROUTER_DEPENDENCY=ROUTER_DEPENDENCY)

      @app.get("/sync/global_di")
      def sync_global_di(r, router_dependencies): # r is the request object
        return router_dependencies["ROUTER_DEPENDENCY"]
    ```

    ```python {{ title: 'typed' }}
      from robyn import Robyn, ALLOW_CORS, Request

      app = Robyn(__file__)
      ROUTER_DEPENDENCY = "ROUTER DEPENDENCY"

      app.inject(ROUTER_DEPENDENCY=ROUTER_DEPENDENCY)

      @app.get("/sync/global_di")
      def sync_global_di(r: Request, router_dependencies):
        return router_dependencies["ROUTER_DEPENDENCY"]
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>

<Row>
<Col>
Note: `router_dependencies`, `global_dependencies` are reserved parameters and **must** be named as such. The order of the parameters does not matter among them. However, the `router_dependencies` and `global_dependencies` must only come after the `request` parameter. 
</Col>
</Row>

## What's next?

Batman, being the familiar with the dark side wanted to know about Exceptions!

Robyn introduced him to the concept of exceptions and how he can use them to handle errors in his application.
