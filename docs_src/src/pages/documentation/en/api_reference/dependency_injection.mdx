## Dependency Injection

Batman wanted to learn about dependency injection in Robyn. Robyn introduced him to the concept of dependency injection and how it can be used in Robyn.



Robyn has two types of dependency injection:
One is for the application level and the other is for the router level.

### Application Level Dependency Injection

<Row>
<Col>
Application level dependency injection is used to inject dependencies into the application. These dependencies are available to all the requests.
</Col>
  <Col>

    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

    ```python
      from robyn import Robyn, ALLOW_CORS

      app = Robyn(__file__)
      GLOBAL_DEPENDENCY = "GLOBAL DEPENDENCY"

      app.inject_global(GLOBAL_DEPENDENCY=GLOBAL_DEPENDENCY)

      @app.get("/sync/global_di")
      def sync_global_di(request, global_dependencies):
        return global_dependencies["GLOBAL_DEPENDENCY"]

    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>


### Router Level Dependency Injection

<Row>
<Col>
Router level dependency injection is used to inject dependencies into the router. These dependencies are available to all the requests of that router.
</Col>
  <Col>

    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

    ```python
      from robyn import Robyn, ALLOW_CORS, Request

      app = Robyn(__file__)
      ROUTER_DEPENDENCY = "ROUTER DEPENDENCY"

      app.inject(ROUTER_DEPENDENCY=ROUTER_DEPENDENCY)

      @app.get("/sync/global_di")
      def sync_global_di(r: Request, router_dependencies):
        return router_dependencies["ROUTER_DEPENDENCY"]
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>

<Row>
<Col>
Note: `router_dependencies`, `global_dependencies` are reserved parameters and **must** be named as such. The order of the parameters does not matter among them. However, the `router_dependencies` and `global_dependencies` must only come after the `request` parameter. 
</Col>
</Row>

### WebSocket Dependency Injection

<Row>
<Col>
WebSockets support the same dependency injection system as HTTP routes. The `global_dependencies` and `router_dependencies` parameters work in the main handler, `on_connect`, and `on_close` callbacks.
</Col>
  <Col>
    <CodeGroup title="WebSocket DI" tag="WebSocket" label="/chat">
    ```python {{ title: 'WebSocket DI' }}
      from robyn import Robyn
      import logging

      app = Robyn(__file__)

      app.inject_global(logger=logging.getLogger(__name__))
      app.inject(cache=RedisCache())

      @app.websocket("/chat")
      async def chat(websocket, global_dependencies=None, router_dependencies=None):
          logger = global_dependencies.get("logger")
          cache = router_dependencies.get("cache")
          logger.info(f"New connection: {websocket.id}")

          while True:
              message = await websocket.receive_text()
              cache.set(f"ws_{websocket.id}", message)
              await websocket.broadcast(f"User {websocket.id}: {message}")

      @chat.on_connect
      async def on_connect(websocket, global_dependencies=None):
          logger = global_dependencies.get("logger")
          logger.info(f"Client connected: {websocket.id}")
          return "Connected"
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>

## What's next?

Batman, being the familiar with the dark side wanted to know about Exceptions!

Robyn introduced him to the concept of exceptions and how he can use them to handle errors in his application.
