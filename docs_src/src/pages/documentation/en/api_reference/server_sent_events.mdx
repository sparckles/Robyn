# Server-Sent Events (SSE)

After learning about [form data handling](/documentation/en/api_reference/form_data), Batman realized he needed a way to push real-time updates to his crime monitoring dashboard. Criminals don't wait for Batman to refresh his browser!

He discovered Server-Sent Events (SSE) - a perfect solution for one-way communication from server to client over HTTP. SSE allows Batman to stream live data to his dashboard without the complexity of full bidirectional communication.

"This is exactly what I need for my crime alerts!" Batman exclaimed. "I can push updates to the dashboard instantly when new crimes are detected."

Server-Sent Events are ideal for:
- Real-time notifications
- Live data feeds
- Progress updates
- Chat applications (server-to-client only)
- Dashboard updates
- Log streaming

## How does it work?

Batman can create Server-Sent Events streams by using the `SSE_Response` and `SSE_Message` classes:

<CodeGroup title="SSE Response" tag="GET" label="/events">

```python {{ title: 'Basic SSE Stream' }}
from robyn import Robyn, SSE_Response, SSE_Message
import time

app = Robyn(__file__)

@app.get("/events")
def stream_events(request):
    def event_generator():
        for i in range(10):
            yield SSE_Message(f"Event {i}", id=str(i))
            time.sleep(1)
    
    return SSE_Response(event_generator())
```
```python {{ title: 'JSON Data Stream' }}
from robyn import Robyn, SSE_Response, SSE_Message
import json
import time

app = Robyn(__file__)

@app.get("/events/json")
def stream_json_events(request):
    def json_event_generator():
        for i in range(5):
            data = {
                "id": i,
                "message": f"Update {i}",
                "timestamp": time.time()
            }
            yield SSE_Message(
                json.dumps(data), 
                event="update", 
                id=str(i)
            )
            time.sleep(2)
    return SSE_Response(json_event_generator())
```

## What's next?

Batman has mastered Server-Sent Events and can now stream real-time updates to his crime dashboard. While SSE is perfect for one-way communication from server to client, Batman realizes he needs bidirectional communication for more interactive features like real-time chat with his allies.

Next, he wants to explore how to handle bidirectional communication with [WebSockets](/documentation/en/api_reference/websockets) for more interactive features.

If Batman needs to handle unexpected situations, he'll learn about [Exception handling](/documentation/en/api_reference/exceptions) to make his applications more robust.

For scaling his crime monitoring system across multiple processes, Batman will explore [Scaling the Application](/documentation/en/api_reference/scaling).
