## Working with Middlewares and Events

As Batman's application grew more complex, Robyn taught him about middlewares, startup and shutdown events, and even working with WebSockets. Batman learned how to create functions that could execute before or after a request, manage the application's life cycle, and handle real-time communication with clients using WebSockets.


## Handling Events

Batman discovered that he could add startup and shutdown events to manage his application's life cycle. He added the following code to define these events:

<Row>
<Col>
Batman was excited to learn that he could add events as functions as well as decorators.
</Col>
  <Col sticky>

    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

    ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
    async def startup_handler():
      print("Starting up")

    app.startup_handler(startup_handler)


    ```

    ```python {{title: 'typed'}}
    @app.shutdown_handler
    def shutdown_handler():
        print("Shutting down")

    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>

<Row>

  <Col>
    For an asynchronous request, Batman used:
  </Col>
  <Col sticky>
    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

      ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
      @app.get("/")
      async def h(request):
          return "Hello, world"

      ```

      ```python {{title: 'typed'}}
      from robyn import Request 

      @app.get("/")
      async def h(request: Request) -> str:
          return "Hello, world"

      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>




## Handling Middlewares {{ tag: 'POST', label: '/http_requests' }}

<Row>
  <Col>

  Batman learned to use both sync and async functions for middlewares. He wrote the following code to add a middleware that would execute before and after each request:

  

  </Col>
  <Col sticky>

    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="POST" label="/http_requests">

    ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
    @app.before_request("/")
    async def hello_before_request(request: Request):
        request.headers["before"] = "sync_before_request"
        print(request)

    @app.after_request("/")
    def hello_after_request(response: Response):
        response.headers["after"] = "sync_after_request"
        print(response)
    ```

    ```python {{ title: 'typed' }}
    from request import Request, Response

    @app.before_request("/")
    async def hello_before_request(request):
        request.headers["before"] = "sync_before_request"
        print(request)

    @app.after_request("/")
    def hello_after_request(response):
        response.headers["after"] = "sync_after_request"
        print(response)
    ```


    </CodeGroup>


  </Col>
</Row>

Robyn - Yes, Authentication!
